the react routing is used for the features like when u click on about u go the about section when u click help u go to the help section...
i will make a file with /about and create a separate component folder 
bina page reload huye..
=> so way of using it
* 
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Routes,
  Route
} from "react-router-dom";
in App.js

 * and use 
 import {
  Link,
  link
}
from 'react-router-dom';

* pehle to router k andar wrap krna hai sab
* then <a> ko <Link> se replace krna hai
* Aur href= ko to= se krna hai
* And in latest version of react-router-dom we use <Routes> instead of <Switch>
* render is not needed in latest verion..
* we can use <Route> directly in <Routes> and use path and element props

//React Developer Tools... is really useful install it...

//when have to build the app for production .. no direct use... 

//way to do so..
* when u click on inspect u will see components and profiler tab 
* and on components  u can see how react app is working
* and on profiler tab u can see how much time is taken by each component to render

//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++//
And if u want to work for production.. 
- U have to create a production build,
- To do so "npm run build".
- This will create a "build" folder in ur project root directory
- then open that "build" folder.

(jo build directory teyaar huyi hai , use hum vs code mai open kre gaye aur then index.html open karenge)
(then open it with live Server)
(then react app open ho jaygi)
(then when u look on the top left corner u will see the extension icon and then u can see that u r using a better development enviornment I MEAN : "This pae is using the production build of React.)
- and open index.html file
- and u will see that all the code is minified and bundled
- and u can see that all the code is bundled in one file





- U can then host ur app on any server like heroku, netlify, vercel etc
- U can also use "npm run start" to start ur app in production mode
