the react routing is used for the features like when u click on about u go the about section when u click help u go to the help section...
i will make a file with /about and create a separate component folder 
bina page reload huye..
=> so way of using it
* 
import {
  BrowserRouter as Router,
  Routes,
  Route
} from "react-router-dom";
in App.js

 * and use 
 import {
  Link,
  link
}
from 'react-router-dom';

* pehle to router k andar wrap krna hai sab
* then <a> ko <Link> se replace krna hai
* Aur href= ko to= se krna hai
* And in latest version of react-router-dom we use <Routes> instead of <Switch>
* render is not needed in latest verion..
* we can use <Route> directly in <Routes> and use path and element props

//React Developer Tools... is really useful install it...

//when have to build the app for production .. no direct use... 

//way to do so..
* when u click on inspect u will see components and profiler tab 
* and on components  u can see how react app is working
